		<h1>Ideahack Creative</h1>
		<p>I've been working on building ideahack with my friend, Cole Nakatani, for nearly two years. Ideahack was initially founded in 2010 by Cole and Andrei Pop, who left ideahack to start his own business <a href="http://humanapi.co/" target="_blank">Human API</a> in San Francisco.</p>
		<p>
		I had a brief stint in Environmental Consulting between 2009 and 2011, until I decided I was not fit for digging holes and getting bitten alive by mosquitos in Northern Canada for a living. Having founded my own design agency <a href="http://www.3ntrance.com" target="_blank">3ntrance</a> in 2008 while I was still a student, my natural next move was to dive back into design consulting full-time. I joined forces with Ideahack Creative in October 2011, and ever since, I've been at the helm of all the creative and technical work being produced.
		</p>
		<p>
		I've worked with industries ranging from fashion, education, construction, to new building technologies, developing campaigns, wordpress sites, shopify e-commerce solutions, print material, and branding.
