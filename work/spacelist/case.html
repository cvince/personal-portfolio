		<h1>UBC Finance Club</h1>
		<p>My legacy for my years at the University of British Columbia was the rebrand of the UBC Finance Club. 2008 was a simpler time. I was an engineering student, and despite being a hobbyist designer since the age of 12, the true power of design, and design thinking never occurred to me until I took the role of VP marketing for one of the faculties' largest student organizations.</p> <p>I look at the years past, and realize my first epiphany started with the bull-head below. With ambitious students always looking to rebrand, hopefully this figure stands the test of time. Until then, this still remains today, my proudest project.</p>
