		<h1>App Annie</h1>
			<p>
				In January 2013, I spent 3 months in Beijing working for a San Francisco based startup called App Annie. App Annie is the market leader in providing global app-store analytics, and in order to promote their credibility as experts in the app-ecosystem, they are involved in numerous content marketing campaigns, and have a heavy presence in industry trade shows. I produced both web and print marketing materials, and was the creative lead on the booth and collateral design, and prior to my departure, spearheaded the branding of App Annie's premium <a href="https://www.appannie.com/intelligence/" target="_blank">intelligence</a> product.
